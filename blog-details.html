              Tours sits on the lower reaches of the Loire, between Orléans and
              the Atlantic coast. Formerly named Caesarodunum by its founder,
              Roman Emperor Augustus, it possesses one of the largest
              amphitheaters of the Roman Empire, the Tours Amphitheatre. Known
              for the Battle of Tours in 732 AD, it is a National Sanctuary with
              connections to the Merovingians and the Carolingians, with the
              Capetians making the kingdom's currency the Livre tournois. Saint
              Martin, Gregory of Tours and Alcuin were all from Tours. Tours was
              once part of Touraine, a former province of France.
